### About me 

<p>Hello, my name is Amzad Hossain. I am a 26-year-old . With experience in machine learning and pattern recognition, I received my BSc degree from North-South University, one of Bangladesh's best private universities. I am a fun-loving individual who is at ease in a variety of situations. In me, I valued a never-say-die attitude. If I may add anything further about myself, I enjoy tinkering with my code because practice makes perfect. In addition to coding, I've recently developed a passion for film editing and human sociology. Furthermore, I am a tremendous football lover, and Real Madrid is my favourite team. My role model is our prophet Mohammad (pbh) and my parents, who are always at my side. I am currently working for a Canada based company called Canada syntex as a machine learning engineer </p>
