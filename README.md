### :white_check_mark: About me 

<p>Hello, my name is Amzad Hossain. I am a 26-year-old . With experience in machine learning and pattern recognition, I received my BSc degree from North-South University, one of Bangladesh's best private universities. I am a fun-loving individual who is at ease in a variety of situations. In me, I valued a never-say-die attitude. If I may add anything further about myself, I enjoy tinkering with my code because practice makes perfect. In addition to coding, I've recently developed a passion for film editing and human sociology. Furthermore, I am a tremendous football lover, and Real Madrid is my favourite team. My role model is our prophet Mohammad (pbh) and my parents, who are always at my side. I am currently working for a Canada based company calledCanada Syntaxs a machine learning engineer </p>

## :white_check_mark: Achivments :mortar_board: :mortar_board: 
#### Research Achivments 
I have some minor achivment in the field of coputer vision and Nlp 

:one: [Real-time Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection Using YOLOv4 and TensorFlow](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9550808)

Confarence : 2021 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Date: August 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; git: [ here ](https://github.com/AmzadHossainrafis/Personal-Protective-Gear-Surveillance-System) &nbsp; &nbsp; 

 &nbsp; in this paper, me and my co-author implemented a servalence system that monitors people from a live camera feed that are people following the mandatory covid prevention   protocols like are people wearing personal protective equipment (mask, face-shield, gloves, ppe) , and also identify who is not following to prevent the rapid spread   of covid 
 
 :two: [ Data Mining Techniques to Categorize Single Paragraph-Formed Self-narrated Stories](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-8354-4_70)
 <br> Confarence : ICT Analysis and Applications &nbsp; &nbsp; Date: December 2020  &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
  in this paper we tried to impliment a text classification from verios scourse lisk social media post using machine learning algorithm like SVM ,Decision tree, Random forest etc .
